# Simon Says Game

This is a simple Simon Says game built with React and Tailwind CSS. The game challenges players to memorize and repeat a
sequence of colors that gets progressively longer with each round.

## How to Play

The goal of Simon Says is to follow and repeat a growing sequence of colors. Each round, the game adds one new color to
the sequence, challenging your memory and attention. Your task is to remember and click the colors in the correct order
as the sequence gets longer.

### Game Rules

1. **Start the Game**: Press the "Start" button to begin.
2. **Watch the Sequence**: The game will highlight a sequence of colors. Memorize this sequence.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence shown.
4. **Progress Through Rounds**: If you repeat the sequence correctly, a new color will be added to the sequence, and the
   next round begins. If you make a mistake, the game will reset.
5. **Complete All Rounds**: Successfully repeating the sequence for 8 rounds will complete the game.
